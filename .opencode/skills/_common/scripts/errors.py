"""Shared error types for template-related failures.

US-4.8 / PLAN-GIT-78 Rev 2 (MINOR-2): ``TemplateError`` was previously defined
only in ``ppt_builder.py``. Importing it from there into
``template-modifier-skill`` would reintroduce the cross-skill production
coupling that PLAN-GIT-72 eliminated. This module is the neutral home in
``_common/scripts/`` — both skills import from here, keeping the dependency
direction inward (skills → _common, never skill → skill).
