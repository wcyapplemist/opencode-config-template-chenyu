## What I do

I fill the PowerPoint template (`template.pptx`) with structured content using `ppt_builder.py`. I am the **only approved method** for generating presentations from structured data.

- Accept a JSON array (`slide_data_list`) and render it into a `.pptx` file
- Resolve Slide Master layouts **by name** (robust to layout reordering)
- Add slides from the template's Slide Master layouts, filling placeholders by type
- Embed **native charts** (editable, not images) and **native pictures**
- Resolve resource placeholders (`data_query`) into real assets before rendering
- **Validate** every deck against a JSON schema (with two-layer retry) before it reaches the engine
- Write English speaker notes to each slide's Notes pane (Presenter View only)
- Handle missing placeholders gracefully with warnings (never crash)

## When to use me

Use this skill when:
- You have structured content (JSON array) and need a `.pptx` output
- You want to populate a Slide Master template with pre-defined layouts

Do NOT use for:
- Creating presentations from scratch
- OOXML editing or raw XML manipulation
- Thumbnail generation or visual analysis

## Template

The engine is **template-agnostic** (Capability A, issues #43/#44/#45): it accepts **any** `.pptx`, introspects it into a JSON contract, and fills it using that template's own layouts — matched by **placeholder-composition fingerprint**, not hardcoded names.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `scripts/templates/template.pptx` | Slide Master template. A user-supplied template **replaces this file at the same path** (new overwrites old). |
| `scripts/templates/template.config.json` | Optional layout-name pins (`<slide_type>_layout` for any of the 8 types). |
| `scripts/templates/template.pptx.contract.json` | Auto-generated introspection contract (mtime-cached, gitignored). |

### User-supplied template (same-path replacement)

To render from a user's own template, **overwrite the base at the single path**, then render normally — introspection runs automatically before every render:

```bash
cp "<user_template>.pptx" scripts/templates/template.pptx
# then call generate_ppt_from_data(...) as usual
```

### Template introspection + capability report

`template_introspector.py` produces the contract (slide size, theme, every layout's placeholders + fingerprint + content area). `servable_slide_types(contract)` reports which of the 8 slide types the template can serve — use it to constrain content to layouts the template actually provides:

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json; sys.path.insert(0,'scripts')
from ppt_builder import servable_slide_types, get_render_contract
print(json.dumps(servable_slide_types(get_render_contract('scripts/templates/template.pptx')), indent=2))
"
```

### Layout resolution (fingerprint-first)

Layouts are resolved **by placeholder-composition fingerprint**, not by index. For each `slide_type` the engine has an ideal placeholder composition (a built-in constant); it matches that to the template layout whose composition fits best. **Layout names are only a tie-breaker / fallback.** Resolution precedence:

1. `template.config.json` pin (`<slide_type>_layout`) — explicit layout name, highest precedence.
2. **Fingerprint match** — composition-closest layout (the template-agnostic path).
3. Name-based fallback (`_LAYOUT_NAME_MAP`) — backward-compatible safety net.
4. Degradation — skip the slide + clear warning (never silent).

Among composition-compatible layouts, ranking is: name affinity → fewest surplus placeholders → largest `content_area_in2` → index. Without a contract the path is the original name-based matching (byte-for-byte backward compatible).

## Input Data Format

**Language: English only.** All slide content AND speaker notes MUST be in English. Do not translate into any other language, even if the request is in Chinese or explicitly asks for a non-English deck.

```json
[
  {
    "slide_type": "title_slide",
    "title": "BETEKK 2026 Q1 Quarterly Review",
    "subtitle": "March 2026",
    "notes": "KEY MESSAGE: Open with energy — set the context in one line.\n\"Hold the slide for two seconds before you speak.\"\n\"Good [morning/afternoon], I'm [Name]. Welcome to our Q1 review — the short version is, we had a strong quarter.\"\nPause. Let it land.\n\"I'll take you through the numbers, then what's next.\"\nTRANSITION: \"Let's look at the numbers.\"\nCOACHING: Eye contact, confident. Do not read the slide."
  },
  {
    "slide_type": "content_slide",
    "title": "Key Business Metrics",
    "body": "**Revenue Growth** — 32% YoY increase\n**New Contracts** — 18 signed this quarter\n**Customer Satisfaction** — 96.5% approval rating",
    "notes": "KEY MESSAGE: Strong across every metric — revenue, pipeline, and satisfaction.\n\"Three numbers tell the story this quarter.\"\n\"Revenue is up thirty-two percent year on year — our fastest growth yet.\"\nPause. Let the number land.\n\"We signed eighteen new contracts, and customer satisfaction sits at ninety-six-point-five percent.\"\n\"Ask yourself: which of these would you lead with to your board?\"\nTRANSITION: \"Here is what actually drove these results.\"\nCOACHING: Matter-of-fact tone. Be ready for: \"Is the satisfaction score biased?\" — answer: independent survey, 200+ respondents."
  }
]
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Required | Slide Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------|
| `slide_type` | Yes | All | One of: `title_slide`, `content_slide`, `section_header_slide`, `two_content_slide`, `comparison_slide`, `content_image_slide`, `chart_slide`, `closing_slide` |
| `title` | Yes | All | Main heading text |
| `subtitle` | No | `title_slide`, `closing_slide` | Subheading text. On `closing_slide`, omit this field — the `End` layout's built-in sign-off block shows by default. |
| `body` | No | `content_slide`, `content_image_slide` | Body content. `\n` = new paragraph. Format: `**Title** — Description` |
| `body_left` / `body_right` | No | `two_content_slide`, `comparison_slide` | Left/right column body (same body-text format) |
| `chart_type` | Yes | `chart_slide` | Chart type: `bar`, `bar_stacked`, `bar_horizontal`, `bar_horizontal_stacked`, `pie`, `pie_exploded`, `doughnut`, `line`, `line_markers` |
| `categories` | Yes | `chart_slide` | Array of category labels (X-axis or pie slice labels) |
| `series` | Yes | `chart_slide` | Array of `{name, values}` objects. Multiple series supported for bar/line. |
| `chart_options` | No | `chart_slide` | Styling options (see Chart Options below) |
| `image_path` | No | `content_image_slide` + any | Local file path of an image to embed as a **native, editable picture**. When set, the engine inserts it (#18). |
| `image_position` | No | any slide with `image_path` | Named placement preset: `full`, `half-left`, `half-right`, `below-title` (default). |
| `image_size` | No | any slide with `image_path` | `{"width": inches, "height": inches}` override of the preset box. |
| `data_query` | No | `chart_slide` | Resource placeholder — asks for real chart statistics; the resolver fills `categories`/`series` with sourced numbers. |
| `data_hint` | No | `chart_slide` | Optional expected shape for `data_query` (e.g. category/series names). |
| `notes` | Yes | All | Full English presenter script (**~120–180 words**). Written to the slide's Notes pane (Presenter View only). `\n` = new paragraph. Must be **spoken dialogue** (quoted, speakable sentences tied to the slide's content), **interspersed stage directions**, a `TRANSITION` line, and `COACHING` with delivery + an anticipated Q&A — NOT bullet summaries. Cover/closing use `[Name]` / `[morning/afternoon]` placeholders. |

### Body Text Parsing

Each line is parsed into a bold title run + description run:
- Split at first ` — `, ` - `, or `: `
- `**` markers stripped automatically
- No card slot limit — body is a single multi-paragraph block

## Chart Slides

The `chart_slide` type generates **native PowerPoint charts** (editable in PowerPoint, not images) using `python-pptx`'s `add_chart()` API. Charts use the `Blank` layout (which has a TITLE placeholder + free space for the chart graphic).

### Chart Type Reference

| `chart_type` | XL_CHART_TYPE | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `bar` | COLUMN_CLUSTERED | Vertical bars (default) |
| `bar_stacked` | COLUMN_STACKED | Stacked vertical bars |
| `bar_horizontal` | BAR_CLUSTERED | Horizontal bars |
| `bar_horizontal_stacked` | BAR_STACKED | Stacked horizontal bars |
| `pie` | PIE | Standard pie chart |
| `pie_exploded` | PIE_EXPLODED | Exploded pie chart |
| `doughnut` | DOUGHNUT | Doughnut chart |
| `line` | LINE | Simple line chart |
| `line_markers` | LINE_MARKERS | Line with data point markers (recommended) |

### Chart Options

All fields inside `chart_options` are optional with sensible defaults:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `legend_position` | string | `"bottom"` | `"bottom"`, `"right"`, `"top"`, `"left"`, or `"none"` |
| `show_data_labels` | bool | `true` | Show value/percentage labels on chart |
| `value_format` | string | `"#,##0.0"` | Number format for bar/line data labels |
| `y_axis_format` | string | `"#,##0.0"` | Number format for Y-axis tick labels |
| `y_axis_min` | float | auto | Y-axis minimum scale |
| `y_axis_max` | float | auto | Y-axis maximum scale |
| `y_axis_major_unit` | float | auto | Y-axis major gridline interval |
| `y_axis_title` | string | `""` | Y-axis title text |
| `x_axis_title` | string | `""` | X-axis title text |

### Theme Styling

Charts automatically use the template's theme:
- **Colors**: 8-color palette extracted from theme accent colors (`accent1`-`accent6` + `dk2` + `accent3`)
- **Fonts**: All chart text uses `Calibri` (theme minor font)
- **Gridlines**: Major gridlines in `#E7E6E6` (theme `lt2`), 0.75pt
- **Axis text**: `#44546A` (theme `dk2`)

### Example: Bar Chart (single series)

```json
{
  "slide_type": "chart_slide",
  "title": "Global Construction Tech Market (USD Billion)",
  "chart_type": "bar",
  "categories": ["2020", "2021", "2022", "2023", "2024", "2025", "2026"],
  "series": [
    {"name": "Market Size", "values": [8.5, 11.2, 14.8, 19.5, 25.1, 31.7, 39.4]}
  ],
  "chart_options": {
    "legend_position": "bottom",
    "show_data_labels": true,
    "y_axis_min": 0,
    "y_axis_max": 45
  },
  "notes": "KEY MESSAGE: Market growing from 8.5B to 39.4B by 2026."
}
```

### Example: Pie Chart

```json
{
  "slide_type": "chart_slide",
  "title": "Technology Adoption Rate",
  "chart_type": "pie",
  "categories": ["BIM", "IoT", "Drones", "AI & ML", "Robotics", "Cloud"],
  "series": [
    {"name": "Adoption %", "values": [68, 45, 52, 28, 15, 72]}
  ],
  "chart_options": {
    "legend_position": "right"
  },
  "notes": "KEY MESSAGE: Cloud and BIM lead adoption at 72% and 68%."
}
```

### Example: Line Chart (multi-series)

```json
{
  "slide_type": "chart_slide",
  "title": "Project Performance Improvement (%)",
  "chart_type": "line_markers",
  "categories": ["2019", "2020", "2021", "2022", "2023", "2024", "2025"],
  "series": [
    {"name": "Cost Savings",       "values": [5, 8, 12, 16, 20, 25, 30]},
    {"name": "Schedule Reduction", "values": [3, 6, 10, 14, 19, 24, 28]},
    {"name": "Safety Improvement", "values": [2, 4,  8, 12, 18, 22, 27]}
  ],
  "chart_options": {
    "legend_position": "bottom",
    "y_axis_min": 0,
    "y_axis_max": 35
  },
  "notes": "KEY MESSAGE: All three metrics show consistent improvement."
}
```

## Image Slides

Any slide carrying an `image_path` embeds a **native, editable PowerPoint picture** (#18). If the layout has a PICTURE placeholder (e.g. `content_image_slide` → `Picture with Caption`), the picture fills it; otherwise it is placed in the free space using a named preset. Images are **embedded** (not linked), so the PPTX is self-contained.

### Placement presets (`image_position`)

| Preset | Region |
|--------|--------|
| `full` | Below title, full width (~11.5" × 4.5") |
| `below-title` | Same as `full` (default) |
| `half-left` | Left half (~5.75" × 4.5") |
| `half-right` | Right half (~5.75" × 4.5") |

Optional `image_size`: `{"width": 6, "height": 3}` (inches) overrides the preset box.

### Example: image slide

```json
{
  "slide_type": "content_image_slide",
  "title": "Drone Surveying in Action",
  "body": "**Aerial scans** - cut survey time by 60%",
  "image_path": "output/site_photo.png",
  "image_position": "full",
  "notes": "KEY MESSAGE: ..."
}
```

## Resource Resolution Pipeline

Instead of fabricating asset URLs or chart numbers, emit **placeholders**; an independent resolver pass replaces them with concrete assets **before** rendering. The agent never touches real URLs — it only describes what it wants.

| Placeholder | Resolved to | Provider |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `data_query` (+ `data_hint`) | populated `categories`/`series` | Agent `webfetch` pre-flight (resolver does NOT network); citation added to notes |

**Concrete values always win** — if a slide already has `image_path` or concrete `series`, the resolver does not overwrite them.

**`data_query` contract.** The chart-data resolver makes **no** network calls. Real numbers must be sourced by the agent's `webfetch` pre-flight and written as concrete `categories`/`series`; **fabricating chart numbers to pass schema validation is forbidden** — every value must trace to a fetched source.

### Pipeline order

```
agent emits placeholders  ->  resolve_slide_data_list()  ->  schema validation  ->  generate_ppt_from_data()
```

```bash
python -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'scripts')
from resolvers import resolve_slide_data_list
resolved = resolve_slide_data_list(<JSON_ARRAY>)   # uses resolver.config.json
"
```

Resolution is **non-fatal**: an unconfigured provider or a failed fetch logs a warning and the slide renders without that asset. The build never fails because of a missing resource.

### Configuration

Copy `scripts/resolver.config.example.json` to `scripts/resolver.config.json` (gitignored) and fill in provider keys. An unconfigured provider makes its resolver skip gracefully. Injectable `fetch_fn` / `match_fn` / `search_fn` keys allow custom providers and tests.

## Schema Validation

Every deck is validated against explicit JSON schemas (`scripts/schemas/`, `scripts/schema_validator.py`) for all 8 slide types and `chart_options` (#20). Validation returns **structured, human-readable errors** (slide index + field path + reason) so the agent can self-correct.

```bash
python -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'scripts')
from schema_validator import validate_slide_data_list
res = validate_slide_data_list(<JSON_ARRAY>, strict=True, density_mode='standard')
print('VALID' if res.is_valid else 'INVALID')
for m in res.error_messages() + res.warning_messages(): print('-', m)
"
```

- **Strict mode** (`strict=True`): missing `notes` and any schema violation block rendering (used by the agent pre-flight gate).
- **Density mode** (`density_mode='standard'|'concise'|'text-heavy'`, optional): runs a per-slide visible-text word-count check against the mode's budget and emits **warnings** on out-of-budget slides. Always non-fatal — never blocks, never promoted by `strict=True`. Omit (`None`) to skip the check entirely.
- **Default mode**: the engine degrades gracefully (skips unknown slide types, defaults bad `chart_type` to `bar`, skips charts missing data) and only aborts on unrecoverable structural breakage (e.g. `slide_data_list` is not an array) with a clear `ValidationError`.

### Two-layer retry (`parse_and_validate`)

For LLM-produced JSON, `parse_and_validate(raw_text)` first **repairs** common mistakes (code fences, trailing commas, single quotes, variable assignments) then **schema-validates** the result — returning clear errors the model can use to self-correct. It also accepts an optional `density_mode` forwarded to the validator.

## Density Modes

A deck-wide **density mode** fixes a per-slide visible-text word budget. It is the primary content-side lever for preventing the text-overflow defect (long content exceeding placeholder boundaries and overlapping neighboring shapes). The agent picks the mode with the user at the outline-confirmation checkpoint (see `pptx-subagent` Stage 2); the validator then warns on any slide whose visible text falls outside the budget.

| Mode | Per-slide words | Use when |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| `concise` | 0–10 | Minimal text, often image-only; keynote/hero decks |
| `standard` ⭐ default | 30–50 | Balanced reporting decks — the safe default |
| `text-heavy` | 75–150 | Dense, document-style decks for self-study/handout |

**What counts toward the budget** — the on-slide visible text only: `title` + `subtitle` + `body` + `body_left` + `body_right`. Markdown emphasis markers (`**`, `_`, backticks) and punctuation-only tokens (the ` — ` / ` - ` / `: ` body-format delimiters) are stripped before counting. Each CJK character counts as one word.

**What is NOT counted** — `notes` (lives in the Notes pane, never renders on the slide), and `chart_slide` `categories`/`series` labels (numeric/temporal, not meaningfully constraining).

**Severity** — out-of-budget slides emit **warnings, never errors**, even in `strict=True` mode. A word-count budget is a soft guideline the agent self-tightens, not a structural rule. `concise` slides at zero words (image-only) are always valid; `title_slide`/`section_header_slide`/`closing_slide` naturally underflow `standard`/`text-heavy` budgets and that underflow is expected/harmless.

```bash
python -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'scripts')
from density_mode import DENSITY_BUDGETS, DEFAULT_DENSITY_MODE, count_slide_words, validate_density
print(DENSITY_BUDGETS)           # {'concise': (0, 10), 'standard': (30, 50), 'text-heavy': (75, 150)}
print(count_slide_words({'title': 'Hi', 'body': '**Point** — desc here'}))  # 4
print(validate_density(<JSON_ARRAY>, 'standard'))  # [] when all in budget
"
```

## Multi-Stage Generation

For best quality on longer decks, the agent generates in three stages: **outline → critique/review → detail+JSON**, with each JSON stage schema-validated before continuing. When run as the **primary** agent, it can pause after the outline for the user to approve/edit; as a **subagent** it runs fully autonomously (self-critique). See `docs/DESIGN-multi-stage-generation.md`.

**Slide count convention.** When the user requests "N pages/slides", that number is the **total** deck size including cover and closing: N ≥ 3 → 1 cover + (N−2) content + 1 closing; N = 2 → cover + 1 content; N = 1 → cover only. The closing slide defaults to `"Thank You"` as its title (matching the `End` layout built-in) with no `subtitle` authored.

**Temp cleanup:** the outline artifact (and any agent-written temp file under `outline_store._TEMP_DIR`, a namespaced system temp dir) is **cleared automatically** after every successful `generate_ppt_from_data` call (default `cleanup_temp=True`). Temp artifacts therefore never pollute the repo or accumulate on disk.

## End-to-End Example: Mixed Text / Image / Chart Deck

A single deck combining text slides, an image slide (via a local `image_path`), and a native chart with concrete values.

```json
[
  {
    "slide_type": "title_slide",
    "title": "Construction Tech 2026",
    "subtitle": "Market & Field Outlook",
    "notes": "KEY MESSAGE: Construction tech is moving from pilot to mainstream.\n\"Good [morning/afternoon], I'm [Name]...\"\nTRANSITION: \"Let's start with the market.\"\nCOACHING: Confident open. Be ready for: \"Is this hype?\" — lead with the growth number."
  },
  {
    "slide_type": "content_slide",
    "title": "Why Now",
    "body": "**Labor gap** - skilled labor shortage accelerates automation\n**Tech maturity** - BIM, IoT, drones now production-ready\n**Cost pressure** - margins demand efficiency",
    "notes": "KEY MESSAGE: Three forces converging.\n\"Three forces are converging right now.\"\nTRANSITION: \"Here's what that means for the market.\"\nCOACHING: Matter-of-fact. Pause after each driver."
  },
  {
    "slide_type": "content_image_slide",
    "title": "Drones on Site",
    "body": "**Aerial surveys** - cut survey time by 60%",
    "image_path": "output/drone_site.png",
    "image_position": "full",
    "notes": "KEY MESSAGE: Drones are already standard on leading sites.\n\"Look at this - one drone flight replaces days of manual surveying.\"\nTRANSITION: \"Now let's see the market numbers.\"\nCOACHING: Let the image land before speaking."

    "chart_type": "bar",
    "categories": ["2022", "2023", "2024", "2025", "2026"],
    "series": [{"name": "Market Size", "values": [14.8, 19.5, 25.1, 31.7, 39.4]}],
    "chart_options": {"legend_position": "bottom", "y_axis_min": 0, "y_axis_max": 45},
    "notes": "KEY MESSAGE: The market nearly triples by 2026.\n\"From fifteen billion to almost forty in four years.\"\nPause. Let the number land.\nTRANSITION: Open for questions.\nCOACHING: Don't over-sell the curve."
  }
]
```

## End-to-End Example: User-Supplied Template (any `.pptx`)

Fill a deck from a template the user brings — no matter its layout names.

```bash
# 1. Replace the base template at the single path.
cp ~/my_company_template.pptx scripts/templates/template.pptx

# 2. Learn what the template can serve (which slide_types, content areas).
python -c "
import sys, json; sys.path.insert(0,'scripts')
from ppt_builder import servable_slide_types, get_render_contract
print(json.dumps(servable_slide_types(get_render_contract('scripts/templates/template.pptx')), indent=2))
"
# → e.g. {"content_slide": {"available": true, "layout": "Content Page", "content_area_in2": 42.1}, ...}
#   Note the layout NAME differs from the default ("Title and Content") — fingerprint
#   matching still resolves it. Author only available slide_types; downshift density
#   if a content_area_in2 is small.

# 3. Render normally — introspection + fingerprint matching happen automatically.
python -c "
import sys, json; sys.path.insert(0,'scripts')
from ppt_builder import generate_ppt_from_data, DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR
slide_data = [
  {'slide_type': 'title_slide', 'title': 'Q2 Review', 'subtitle': '2026', 'notes': '...'},
  {'slide_type': 'content_slide', 'title': 'Highlights', 'body': '**A** — x\n**B** — y', 'notes': '...'},
  {'slide_type': 'closing_slide', 'title': 'Thank You', 'notes': '...'},
]
print(generate_ppt_from_data(slide_data, output_path=str(DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR / 'from_user_template.pptx')))
"
```

The output deck uses the user template's own layouts, theme, and master — fully native and editable.

## Output Path

Output files saved under `<project_root>/output/`.

## Multi-aspect-ratio output (US-4.6)

Pass `target_size` to render the deck at a **different aspect ratio** than the template's native size — every element (placeholders, background chrome, charts, images) scales proportionally to the new dimensions.

- **Accepted forms**: a preset (`"16:9"`, `"4:3"`, `"1:1"`) or an explicit dict `{"width_in": W, "height_in": H}` (or `width_emu`/`height_emu`).
- **No-op gate**: when the target **ratio** equals the template's native ratio (or `target_size` is omitted), the default native-size path runs unchanged — no rescaling.
- **How it works**: the engine resizes the canvas and proportionally rescales every master/layout shape, then fills the (now target-sized) placeholders exactly as on the native path — so fonts/theme/bullets stay on-brand via normal layout inheritance.
- **Self-describing output**: the output's embedded schema `slide_dimensions` is rewritten to the target size, so the deck is re-usable as a target-sized template. The `<output>.render.json` sidecar records `aspect_ratio` (native→target + scale factors).

```python
generate_ppt_from_data(slide_data, output_path='report_43.pptx', target_size='4:3')
generate_ppt_from_data(slide_data, output_path='report_square.pptx', target_size={'width_in': 7.5, 'height_in': 7.5})
```

CLI: `python ppt_builder.py -d slides.json -o report.pptx --target-size 4:3` (preset or `WxH` inches like `10x7.5`).

## Execution

```bash
python -c "
import json, sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'scripts')
from ppt_builder import generate_ppt_from_data, DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR

slide_data = <JSON_ARRAY>
result = generate_ppt_from_data(
    slide_data,
    output_path=str(DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR / 'report.pptx'),
    target_size=None,  # US-4.6: '4:3' / '16:9' / '1:1' / {'width_in':..,'height_in':..} or None (native)
)
print(result)
"
```

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `slide_data_list` not a JSON array | Raise `ValidationError` (fatal, clear message) |
| Structural schema violation (strict mode) | Raise `ValidationError` with slide index + field path |
| Unknown `slide_type` | Log warning, skip, continue (graceful) |
| Missing placeholder | Log warning, skip field, continue |
| Single slide fails | Log error, skip slide, continue |
| Template file missing | Raise `FileNotFoundError` (fatal) |
| Unknown `chart_type` | Default to `bar`, log warning |
| Missing `categories` or `series` | Skip chart, log warning |
| Invalid `chart_options` field | Ignore, use default |
| `image_path` file not found | Skip image, log warning |
| Unknown `image_position` | Default to `below-title`, log warning |
| Resolver provider unconfigured / fetch failed | Skip asset, log warning (non-fatal) |
| Slide over/under density budget (`density_mode` set) | Validation warning (non-fatal, never blocks, even in strict mode) |

## Output

Returns the **absolute path** of the generated `.pptx` file.
