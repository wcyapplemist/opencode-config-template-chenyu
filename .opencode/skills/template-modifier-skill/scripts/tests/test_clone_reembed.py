"""C1 re-embed guard test (US-4.1 architecture review).

architecture review C1: after cloning, the derived template_new.pptx must carry
embedded JSON (python-pptx's prs.save strips it otherwise). The re-embed logic
in state_machine.resolve_and_clone is guarded on ``active != template_path`` so
that when clone_for_over_limit SKIPS (no donor) and returns the BASE path, the
base template is NOT modified by a spurious re-embed. This file tests that guard.

(The positive path — re-embed of a real template_new.pptx — uses the already-
tested extract_schema/embed_schema primitives, and is only reachable when a clone
actually succeeds. The bundled template has no donor for content_slide, so a
clone cannot be triggered there; the guard test below is the stable, meaningful
coverage for this code path on the bundled template.)
